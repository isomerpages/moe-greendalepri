## **Netball (Girls Only)**

Netball is the number one girls' school sport in Singapore with 330 schools running it as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). The Netball CCA in Greendale Primary School aims to provide opportunities for pupils to learn and apply the fundamental netball skills and simple court play strategies in playing a netball game.

  

The pupils will also learn to embrace the values of excellence, sportsmanship and fair play. Training involves basic ball skills, stamina building, agility and coordination exercises under the close supervision of the coach and teachers-in-charge.

  

Team Greendale will also be training progressively to prepare pupils to represent the school in the North Zone Netball Tournament and carnivals organised by Netball Singapore. We look forward to maximising the exposure and experience of the girls in our CCA.
