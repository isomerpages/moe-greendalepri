Badminton is a sport for two or four people. In this way, the game consists of either one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net.

  

The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back properly before it hits the floor. Every time this is done, the player or pair gets one point. The winner of the rally gets to serve. The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game. The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets.

  

The Greendale Badminton Team comprises of both male and female players where they learn basic footwork, game rules, scoring system, various racquet skills and techniques such as grip, serving, smash as well as net play.

  

In addition to court rules and racket skills, pupils also learn how school values are incorporated in the sport such as resilience as well as commitment and collaboration. The CCA also allows the pupils to make friends across various levels.

  

To date, our team currently has a total of 4 School Teams representing the school in various competitions such as National School Games: Junior Boys, Junior Girls, Senior Boys and Senior Girls.
