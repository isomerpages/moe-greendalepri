## **Happenings**


  

### **North Zone Primary Schools Table-Tennis Championship**

Our boys took part in both the Junior and Senior Team North Zone Primary Schools Table-Tennis Championship in April. We have all witnessed some of our table tennis athletes that exemplifies the attributes of character, skills and sportsmanship in the true spirit of the games. Our players were not afraid of failure, they made mistakes, admitted it and learnt from it.
