## **Parents Gateway**

**<u>Parents Gateway (PG)</u>**

The Parent Gateway (PG) Mobile Application is an initiative by MOE to enable parents to interact with schools more conveniently on administrative and financial matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on the school’s termly calendar of events and after-school activities, pdate their contact numbers and make travel declarations.

  

PG is currently **only available as a mobile application**.  Supported operating system versions are Android 5.0 or later and iOS 9.1 or later. As there are many new features scheduled to be rolled out to make the app more convenient for parents’ use, MOE is unable to prioritize a web version of PG at this juncture.

  

**The PG App has been implemented in Greendale Primary School with effect from Term 2 of Yr2019.** Our teachers will leverage on PG to issue consent forms for your child’s participation in CCAs and learning journeys.

  

If you have SingPass, we encourage you to download the PG mobile app on your mobile phone and perform a simple one-time onboarding process.
