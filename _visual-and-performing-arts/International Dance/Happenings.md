## **Happenings**

Team Greendale's International Dance dancers, also known as Greendalites, are working hard in preparation for two dance competitions. Despite the hectic training, Greendalites will ensure a captivating performance to wow the judges. Winning will be sweet but losing won't make us bitter.

  

  

**Colour The Wind, Let's Go (Thursday, 22 June 2017)**<br>
16 dancers will be competiting whilst giving back to the society as they perform in front of 60 hospice patients and invited guests. For the first time, HCA Hospice Care is organizing a dance competition cum VIA programme. Entitled **Colour the wind, let’s Go**, the competition aims to provide an alternative platform via dance for students to express their appreciation for the silver generation and to create awareness of their needs and to inspire the young to actively participate in care-giving. Our pupils will be competiting at Aliwal Arts Centre, together with other primary, secondary and tertiary pupils.
