## **Choir**

GDPS Choir started in 2010 with the vision of developing students with a passion for singing. It is also a platform for students to enhance their school values, such as strengthening resilience and collaborating in a team.

  

The choir members undergo rigorous vocal and solfege training with an objective to develop each member to their fullest potential.

  

Today, our musically-inclined members are able to blend their voices harmoniously and apply their musical skills in their ensemble.

  

Our members are also exposed to a repository of musical genres. They are also given opportunities for in-house and outdoor performances. In the recent 2018 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Choir, GPDS choir obtained the Certificate of Commendation.
