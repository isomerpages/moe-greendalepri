<p>At MK, we believe preschool children are curious, active and competent
learners. Theyâ€™re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they
learn best through active learning.</p>
<p>We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through
activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour.</p>
<h4>Our Programmes</h4>
<p>Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes, the HI-Light Programme
and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language
(MTL). In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder
project.</p>
