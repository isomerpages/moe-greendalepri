**Philosophy** (Learning Outcomes)


We aim to level up our students’ proficiency in listening, speaking, reading and writing through various engaging and student-centred activities. To achieve that, we put in place rigorous academic structures to support our students in the development of these skills. In addition, to instil the ‘joy of learning’ in our students, we employ technology and creative methods to make their learning more engaging, meaningful and relevant.

  

**Key Programmes**

Our teachers have carefully designed activities and programmes for our students to improve their mastery of the language as well as to enable them to enjoy learning the language. To help us achieve this, the curriculum includes an extensive reading programme in which our students are exposed to reading materials of different genres with accompanying activities. Supplementary learning materials are also developed to enrich their learning. Through this programme, students learn about characterisation, plot and they are able to complete book reviews.

  

The teachers also leverage on technology such as mobile applications, Moo-O and Newsmaker software as well as content-rich portals such SLS and iMTL Portal to arouse students’ interest and to encourage self-directed learning.

  

Besides developing our students to become passionate Malay Language learners, cultural activities are conducted so that they can truly appreciate their roots and traditions. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight, we organise two weeks of fun-filled cultural activities. Through these activities, we aim to instil in our students a sense of love for Malay culture that is vital in the learning of Malay language.  The activities include recess activities where students get to play games and take part in quizzes. Classroom activities such as learning poetry, dramatisation and calligraphy are also carried out. In addition, a language and cultural camp for the Primary 5 students is carried out during the Mother Tongue Fortnight. Inter-class competitions are also carried out during this period so that our students’ interest in the language can be piqued and developed.

  

We also carefully plan and select enrichment programmes in which students are given the opportunity to learn beyond the confines of the classroom. For example, a Speech and Drama Programme for our Primary 1 and 2 students and Drama Programme for our Primary 3 and 4 students. Our students are also given the opportunity to watch plays in theatres to enhance their literary knowledge and learn about theatre etiquette.
