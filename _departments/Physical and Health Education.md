**Physical Education**

  

Physical Education (PE) in Greendale Primary School aims to nurture holistic, healthy and fit students who are equipped with fundamental motor and games skills, knowledge, attitudes and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living individually and with others. The PE curriculum, spans across seven learning areas, namely Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness and Swimming (Primary 3 Swimsafer Enrichment).

For effective delivery of our PE programme, we take reference from the 21st Century Framework in the explicit teaching of values, social emotional competencies and soft skills required to thrive in a fast-changing and connected world. We apply **Body, Space, Effort and Relationships (BSER) Framework** in the teaching of fundamental movement skills and concepts, as well as [Games Concept Approach (GCA)](/files/Games%20Concept%20Approach%20(GCA).pdf) for the teaching of Sports and Games skills and concepts.


  
We have planned a series of key events and learning experiences to allow our students to acquire movement competencies as well as to have the opportunity to have regular participation in physical activities.
