**Physical Education**

  

Physical Education (PE) in Greendale Primary School aims to nurture holistic, healthy and fit students who are equipped with fundamental motor and games skills, knowledge, attitudes and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living individually and with others. The PE curriculum, spans across seven learning areas, namely Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness and Swimming (Primary 3 Swimsafer Enrichment).

For effective delivery of our PE programme, we take reference from the 21st Century Framework in the explicit teaching of values, social emotional competencies and soft skills required to thrive in a fast-changing and connected world. We apply **Body, Space, Effort and Relationships (BSER) Framework** in the teaching of fundamental movement skills and concepts, as well as [Games Concept Approach (GCA)](/files/Games%20Concept%20Approach%20(GCA).pdf) for the teaching of Sports and Games skills and concepts.


  
We have planned a series of key events and learning experiences to allow our students to acquire movement competencies as well as to have the opportunity to have regular participation in physical activities.

**Health Education**

  

Through Health Education, we aim to help students understand the importance of being physically active, practise good health and safety habits, and maintain a balanced diet in their pursuit of an active and healthy lifestyle. For example, we teach the latest ‘Healthy Plate’ model as recommended by Health Promotion Board (HPB), which replaces the Food Pyramid that was previously advocated.

**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

  

PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary One and Two students in our school.  It offers learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful.  More importantly, PAL contributes to the development of soft skills in our students such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others, having a lively curiosity about the world they live in and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge. Furthermore, PAL broadens the learning experiences and positively influences their future experiences. Through PAL, we aim for our students to

*   exhibit confidence in what they do and express themselves effectively
*   exhibit curiosity and positive attitudes to learn
*   enjoy group experiences and teamwork

  

The domains for students’ experiential learning are as follow:

  

<u>Primary 1</u>

*   Sports and Games
*   Dance
*   Visual Arts

<u>Primary 2</u>

*   Outdoor Education
*   Drama
*   Visual Arts
