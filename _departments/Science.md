## **Science**

![](/images/Departments/Science%20Dept.jpg)


The Science Curriculum @ Greendale aims to achieve a balance between the acquisition of science knowledge, process and attitudes in the pupils. Pupils are also made aware of the technological and social implications and the value aspects of science.

  

Central to the Greendale curriculum is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry in the pupils. The conduct of inquiry is founded on the following domains of

(a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application<br>
(b) Skills and Processes and<br>
(c) Ethics and Attitudes

  

The school adopts an inquiry-based approach in the teaching and learning of Science. Lessons are designed based on the **5Es – Explore, Engage, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate** to pique our pupils’ interest in Science as well as to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry in our pupils.

  

**Learning Outcomes**

  

Our pupils will be able to:

  

*   Develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes such as objectivity, creativity and objectivity to carry out scientific inquiry

  

*   Use scientific concepts integrating with skills and processes to inquire phenomena around them

  

*   Use scientific knowledge and methods to make personal decisions

  

*   Appreciate how Science influences people and their environment

  

  

**Learning Experiences**

  

Children develop and learn through interactions, first with adults (parents and teachers), second with their peers and third, the environment. The environment takes on the role of the Third Teacher. In Greendale, our Science department firmly believes in the importance of the Third Teacher. We have a series of learning programmes that utilises the environment to help with the children’s learning.

  

**<u>(a) Outdoor Science Programme</u>**

  

Started in 2016, the programme provides more opportunities for the pupils to learn beyond their classrooms. It aims to raise pupils' awareness and appreciation of the biodiversity in our school environment. With the help of our parent volunteers, pupils get the chance to learn more about plants and life cycle of animals, such as butterflies and stick insects during recess. Pupils learn to make organic products such as Roselle jam, aloe vera lotion and insect repellent using the herbs, spices and plants in the garden.

**<u>(b) Eco-trail at Greendale Eco-garden</u>**

Our Primary 3 pupils will explore the eco-garden and leverage on ICT to learn more about the diversity of plants and the functions of the different plant parts.

**<u>(c) Animal Encounter</u>**

Every year, our Primary 3 pupils will have a fun and engaging time learning about the “Diversity of Animals” by watching documentaries of animals and interacting with live animals such as hamsters and chicks.  The hands-on lessons enable the pupils to activate their sensory skills. These lessons also serve to inculcate in the pupils a sense of responsibility and care for the animals.

**<u>(d) Hydroponics Programme for Primary 3 and 5</u>**

Primary 3 and 5 pupils will experience growing vegetables using hydroponics. They have the opportunity to investigate the conditions that affect the plant growth whilst learning to take care of the plants.

**Environmental Education**

  

Environmental Education in GDPS seeks to engage the head, heart and hands of the school community to build an eco-conscious culture through the R4E framework.

  

Our Environmental Education committee aims to shape our students’ attitude towards caring for the environment through enhancing the green culture and infusing environmental education in the school curriculum. The pupils translated the knowledge and skills in protecting the environment into various environmental projects and outreach programmes the school community has carried out.

**Learning Journeys**

  

**<u>(a) Diversity of Cells @ DNA Lab</u>**

Our Primary 5 pupils will participate in workshops at the DNA Lab in Science Centre. During this workshop, they learn about cell diversity, the use of the microscope to view and slides preparation.

**<u>(b) S.E.A. Aquarium Wonders of the Sea and Leaf Litter/ Pond Study @ Science Centre</u>**

Our Primary 6 pupils would have the chance to study the different habitats and the adaptations of the organisms in the different communities at the SEA Aquarium and Singapore Science Centre. They also learn about the food relationships amongst the various organisms in the different habitats.

**<u>(c) Annual Science Week</u>**

Every year during Science Week, our Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils set up booths to share Science concepts through fun games and activities! Pupils get to showcase and share their work with their peers at recess. Activities are also planned for the P1 and P2 pupils to expose them to Science. Science applications and concepts are brought to life in a weeklong of fun-filled activities.
