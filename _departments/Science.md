## **Science**

![](/images/Departments/Science%20Dept.jpg)


The Science Curriculum @ Greendale aims to achieve a balance between the acquisition of science knowledge, process and attitudes in the pupils. Pupils are also made aware of the technological and social implications and the value aspects of science.

  

Central to the Greendale curriculum is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry in the pupils. The conduct of inquiry is founded on the following domains of

(a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application<br>
(b) Skills and Processes and<br>
(c) Ethics and Attitudes

  

The school adopts an inquiry-based approach in the teaching and learning of Science. Lessons are designed based on the **5Es – Explore, Engage, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate** to pique our pupils’ interest in Science as well as to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry in our pupils.

  

**Learning Outcomes**

  

Our pupils will be able to:

  

*   Develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes such as objectivity, creativity and objectivity to carry out scientific inquiry

  

*   Use scientific concepts integrating with skills and processes to inquire phenomena around them

  

*   Use scientific knowledge and methods to make personal decisions

  

*   Appreciate how Science influences people and their environment

  

  

**Learning Experiences**

  

Children develop and learn through interactions, first with adults (parents and teachers), second with their peers and third, the environment. The environment takes on the role of the Third Teacher. In Greendale, our Science department firmly believes in the importance of the Third Teacher. We have a series of learning programmes that utilises the environment to help with the children’s learning.

  

**<u>(a) Outdoor Science Programme</u>**

  

Started in 2016, the programme provides more opportunities for the pupils to learn beyond their classrooms. It aims to raise pupils' awareness and appreciation of the biodiversity in our school environment. With the help of our parent volunteers, pupils get the chance to learn more about plants and life cycle of animals, such as butterflies and stick insects during recess. Pupils learn to make organic products such as Roselle jam, aloe vera lotion and insect repellent using the herbs, spices and plants in the garden.
