<h2><strong>Principal's Foreword</strong></h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:233px;height:310px;margin-right:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/About%20Us/Principal.jpg"></div><p>I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits as we embark on the new academic year, 2024. It is with immense joy and enthusiasm that I welcome each and every one of you to Greendale Primary School. As we come together once again, let us celebrate the possibilities that lie ahead and the sense of unity that makes our school community truly remarkable.</p><p>To our returning students, I extend a warm welcome back. Your dedication to learning, growth, and support for one another is what makes our school special. I encourage you to continue pushing the boundaries of your potential and explore new avenues of knowledge and personal development. Embrace every challenge as an opportunity to learn, and let your curiosity lead the way.</p><p>To our new students and their parents, I extend a heartfelt welcome to the Greendale family. We are thrilled to have you join us, and we promise to nurture your individuality while fostering a sense of belonging. Your unique perspectives and talents will undoubtedly enrich our school community, and we look forward to witnessing your growth and accomplishments.</p><p>I also want to express my gratitude to our dedicated team of educators and staff. Your passion for teaching and unwavering commitment to our students’ well-being are the driving forces behind our school’s success. As we continue this journey together, let us stand united, supporting one another to create an environment where excellence thrives.</p><p>At Greendale Primary School, we believe in the power of collaboration and open communication. My heartfelt appreciation to our esteemed partners in the PSG and SAC for being strong pillars of support for the school. We value our parents’ partnership as active participants in your child’s education. Your involvement and support make a significant difference in their academic achievements and overall development. Let’s work hand in hand to ensure their success. I encourage you to stay connected with our school through Parents Gateway, school website, social media channels, and regular communication updates. These platforms will provide you with important announcements, academic resources, and information about upcoming events.</p><p>As we progress through the academic year, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of excellence, innovation, and inclusivity. We will provide a safe, nurturing, and intellectually stimulating environment that empowers every student to discover their strengths and reach their full potential.</p><p>Together, we will focus on fostering 21CC such as adaptive thinking and communications, as well as empathy, and resilience. Considering the Future of Learning vision and the EdTech Masterplan announcements, the Key Personnel (KP) and staff reviewed our school’s Strategic Plans at the end of 2023. Moving forward to 2024, the school will be more deliberate in adopting our school vision of ‘A vibrant community of confident and self-directed learners anchored in values’ and be closely guided by our GRAC2E values and refreshed mission of “Inspiring Minds, Nurturing Hearts, Empowering Growth.”</p><p>The school has been on the right track, and we will press on with the same indomitable spirit of shaping the future of learning for our Greendalites. We will continue to integrate modern educational practices and technology, equipping our students with the skills they need to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p><p>On this note, I encourage all students to actively engage in co-curricular activities, clubs, and sports. These experiences not only enrich your time at school but also offer invaluable life lessons in teamwork, leadership, and time management.</p><p>In closing, I wish everyone a memorable and fulfilling academic year ahead. Let us approach each day with a sense of wonder and determination, knowing that together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in the school. Let’s make the 2024 school year a time of growth, learning, and cherished memories.<br>Ad Astra!<br><br><strong>Mrs Noorismawaty Sng-Ismail</strong><br>Principal<br>January 2024</p>
