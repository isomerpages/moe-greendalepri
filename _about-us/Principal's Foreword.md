<p>Welcome to the 2025 school year!&nbsp;As we begin the new academic year,
I would like to express our commitment to providing a supporting and enriching
environment where every student thrives. Let us celebrate the possibilities
that lie ahead as the school embraces the Future of Learning initiatives,
namely the more deliberate infusion of 21CC and technology in key aspects
of student learning and development in the school.</p>
<p>In GDPS, we strive to develop students into active learners who engage
deeply with the world around them. We believe that learning is not confined
to textbooks; it is a dynamic process that thrives on curiosity and exploration.
To achieve this, we encourage students’ involvement in various projects
that stimulate critical thinking and creativity. We promote reading across
the curriculum, enabling students to connect ideas and integrate knowledge
and skills in meaningful ways. We also adopt thematic learning in the school’s
signature programme – our Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life
Programme - as a cornerstone of our approach, allowing students to explore
subjects in an interconnected manner that reflects real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Equally important is our commitment to students’ well-being. The school’s
student development initiatives aim to provide learning experiences that
foster a healthy lifestyle and instill positive values. While we strive
for academic excellence, we also place significant emphasis on mental health
and overall well-being. We recognize that a healthy mind is just as crucial
as a healthy body, and we are dedicated to supporting our students holistically.</p>
<p>We believe that a strong partnership between home, community and school
is essential for every child's success. The school would continue to nurture
sustained &nbsp;partnerships with our School Advisory Committee, Parents’
Support Group and industry partners. We encourage exploration, open communication
and collaboration throughout the year to ensure that we are supporting
our students’ unique needs and aspirations. Thank you for being part of
our efforts to achieve the school Vision of <strong><em>A Vibrant Community of Confident and Self-directed Learners Anchored in Values.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Together, we will continue to forge meaningful partnerships to bring out
the best in every child.</p>
<p>Ad Astra!
