<p>As we welcome 2026, I extend my warmest greetings to our beloved students,
parents, staff, alumni, and valued partners. A new year brings renewed
hope, fresh possibilities, and a shared commitment to nurture every child
to be the best that they can be.</p>
<p>Our school remains guided by our <strong>Vision</strong> of being a <strong><em>Vibrant Community of Confident and Self-directed Learners Anchored in Values</em></strong>.
We aspire to develop every student into a <strong>Confident Individual, a Self-directed Learner, and a Gracious Citizen</strong>—one
who acts with integrity, empathy, and a strong sense of responsibility
towards others and the community.</p>
<p>Anchored in our <strong>Mission</strong> of <strong><em>Inspiring Minds, Nurturing Hearts, and Empowering Growth</em></strong>,
we provide a holistic education that goes beyond academic excellence. We
seek to spark curiosity, cultivate compassion, and empower students to
take ownership of their learning while developing resilience and moral
courage. Through purposeful experiences in and beyond the classroom through
our signature programmes, our students learn to lead with confidence and
serve with humility.</p>
<p>In preparing our students for an ever-evolving world, we place strong
emphasis on 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and the meaningful integration
of technology through our Future of Learning initiatives. By leveraging
innovative pedagogies and digital tools, we nurture critical and inventive
thinkers, effective communicators, and collaborative team players. Technology
is used thoughtfully to enhance learning, deepen understanding, and equip
our students with future-ready skills.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that education is a shared responsibility. Hence, we
value close partnerships with parents, industry partners, and the wider
community. Such collaborations enrich our students’ learning experiences,
provide authentic real-world connections, and ensure strong support for
their holistic development. Together, we model the values and dispositions
we hope to see in our children.</p>
<p>As we embark on the year ahead, let us move forward with unity, optimism,
and purpose. May the coming year be one of meaningful learning, personal
growth, and shared successes for our entire school community.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a joyful, fulfilling, and rewarding New Year. Ad Astra!
<br>
