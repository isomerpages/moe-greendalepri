<label for="accordion5">School Bus Service</label><div>
<p><u>SFX Transport Services</u> 
<br>
<br>The school's appointed daily school bus operator for Year 2025 is SFX Transport Services. The bus operator can be contacted at tel:
88000262 / 6282 0262 or email:<a href="mailto:greendalepri@sfxtransport.com.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">greendalepri@sfxtransport.com.sg</a>
</p>
<p>School bus request for Year 2025 should be submitted to SFX Transport
	Services online by <b>22 November 2024 (Fri).</b>Please download the app using this link: <a href="https://sfxschool.plotigo.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://sfxschool.plotigo.app/</a> to register your child/ward.</p>
<p>We wish to share that the school bus operator is not obliged to provide
transport services where the distance between the pick-up and/or drop-off
location is more than 4km from the school, or where your child/ward requires
after-school drop off for activities ending after 4pm.</p>
<p>If your child is not taking the school bus (e.g. if he/she is on medical
leave), please inform the driver.</p>
<p>In the first two months of school, the timings for pick-up and drop-off
for your child might vary by 10-15 minutes due to the traffic conditions
and the student attendance taking process during school dismissal. The
driver may also make adjustments to the routes. We seek your understanding
and patience on this.</p>
