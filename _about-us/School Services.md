##### **Student Care Subsidies**

I wish to apply for the Student Care Financial Assistance (SCFA) Scheme. I acknowledge that my application and quantum of subsidy are subject to the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s (MSF) approval. Student care subsidies are provided by MSF. The SCFA Scheme is available to families whose gross monthly household income does not exceed $4,500 or gross per capita income not exceeding $1,125.
