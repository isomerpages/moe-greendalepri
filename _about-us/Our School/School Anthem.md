A journey to the stars. Together hand in hand. With passion, we will <br>strive to learn. Seek to understand. With courage, we will face the challenges ahead.<br>With confidence, our best we give, care and serve as we live. Greendale, arise!<br>Greendale, arise! No matter what the challenge is, together we will<br>thrive. Greendale, believe! Greendale, achieve! Like stars above we’ll <br>shine so bright. Reach up and let our dreams take flight.
