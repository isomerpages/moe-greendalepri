A journey to the stars.&nbsp;Together hand in hand.&nbsp;With passion, we will <br>strive to learn.&nbsp;Seek to understand.&nbsp;With courage, we will face the challenges ahead.<br>With confidence, our best we give, care and serve as we live.&nbsp;Greendale, arise!<br>Greendale, arise!&nbsp;No matter what the challenge is, together we will<br>thrive.&nbsp;Greendale, believe! Greendale, achieve!&nbsp;Like stars above weâ€™ll <br>shine so bright.&nbsp;Reach up and let our dreams take flight.
