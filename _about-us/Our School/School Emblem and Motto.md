=======================

  

#### **Our Emblem**

G for Greendale!

  

The school emblem shows the letter of the **alphabet "G"** drawn with a bold artistic brush stroke, supporting a circle emerging from an orange box. The green is symbolic of a **youth in harmony** with others and with the environment. The orange depicts the **vibrant school environment** that fans the **passion for learning**. Drawn with the traditional brush, the strokes signify the focus of the school in **developing children of character**, anchored in traditional values. The emerging circle underlines the mission of the school in **developing the whole child** through balanced educational programmes, moulding them to be **innovative and global in outlook**, and **daring to aspire high** – to the stars!
