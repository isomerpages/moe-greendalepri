<h1>School Emblem and Motto</h1><h4><strong>Our Emblem</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:40%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/school%20logo.jpg"></div><p>G for Greendale!</p><p>The school emblem shows the <strong>letter "G"</strong>&nbsp;drawn with a bold artistic brush stroke, supporting a circle emerging from an orange box. The green is symbolic of a&nbsp;<strong>youth in harmony</strong>&nbsp;with others and with the environment. The orange depicts the&nbsp;<strong>vibrant school environment</strong>&nbsp;that fans the&nbsp;<strong>passion for learning</strong>. Drawn with the traditional brush, the strokes signify the focus of the school in&nbsp;<strong>developing children of character</strong>, anchored in traditional values. The emerging circle underlines the mission of the school in&nbsp;<strong>developing the whole child</strong>&nbsp;through balanced educational programmes, moulding them to be&nbsp;<strong>innovative and global in outlook</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>daring to aspire high</strong>&nbsp;â€“ to the stars!</p><p><strong>Our Motto</strong></p><p>Ad Astra<br>(To the Stars)</p>
