_KIDS DON’T COME WITH AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL_

  

As we all know, kids don’t come with an instruction manual, so chances are, as parents, we are all looking for **practical help with some common parenting problems**.

  

It might be **challenges** getting your child to do his/her homework, or managing a child who is rude or defiant.

  

Or there **might be no problems at all**. You might be thinking about how best to support your child, to set a homework routine or to encourage healthy computer habits.

  

Thankfully, Greendale Primary is offering a toolbox of parenting tips and strategies for parents of P3 and P4 students.  It is a programme called **Triple P (Positive Parenting Program)**, developed by clinical psychologist Prof Matt Sanders at the University of Queensland, through more than 30 years of clinical research trials.

  

**<u>Aim</u>**
