## **Biodiversity Audit**


On 21 April 2017, fifteen of our Community in Nature (CIN) members conducted a biodiversity audit using the SGBioAtlas application on iPads. Pupils had attended a workshop beforehand on the different plant growth forms, as well as the points to take note during recording, including the details of what is to be written and the type of photos to be taken.

  

In groups of 3 to 4, our pupils surveyed the flora in the new garden plot and gained hands-on experience in conducting wildlife surveys while honing their observational skills. By sharing their biodiversity sightings, they also created a deeper impression of the flora that are present in the school.
