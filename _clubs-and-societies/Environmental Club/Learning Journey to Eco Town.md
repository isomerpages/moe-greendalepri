## **Learning Journey to Eco-Town**


On 20 January 2017, our Environmental Club members had the opportunity to visit Punggol Town Square to learn about our first Eco-Town in Singapore. Our pupils experienced first-hand how numerous green innovations in Punggol support eco-friendly high-rise living. These innovations range from freshwater mangroves that filter and clean the water, to themed outdoor furniture made from recycled materials, creating a sustainable and liveable green environment for its residents.
