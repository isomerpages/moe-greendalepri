## **Learning Journey to EcoTown**


On 19 May 2017, our members participated in a learning journey to Punggol Ecotown conducted by Secondary Two students from Punggol Secondary School (PSS). Through fun games and sharing of Ecotownâ€™s various features, including energy efficient solutions, green spaces and resource efficiency at different stations, the members gained more awareness of its eco-design while exploring the ground level of the estate.

  

Through sufficient background research, the PSS students created interesting learning aids that allowed our members to learn about eco-living being as well as being a good neighbour. We hope that our members will grow in greater appreciation of their living environment, become role models on good neighbourliness, responsible heartland living as well as to adopt water and energy conservation as a lifestyle.
