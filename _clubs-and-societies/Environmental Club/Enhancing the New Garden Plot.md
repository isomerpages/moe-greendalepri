## **Enhancing the New Garden Plot**


On 31 March 2017, 17 Community in Nature (CIN) members planted a number of plants purchased with the Garden City Fund to optimise the green spaces in school. The types of plants included Ardisia crenata, Dianella ensifolia, and Pluchea indica.

  

The pupils applied various skills during the session. Equipped with tools and gloves, the pupils worked in pairs to place the plants and fill the remaining spaces in the holes with soil. It required some level of precision, as they were reminded to bury the roots in alignment with the surface level of the ground. They also had to learn to keep the environs clean and tidy as part of their gardening effort. The pupils were engaged in beautifying our compound, and learnt that they too, can play a part in contributing to a greener environment.
