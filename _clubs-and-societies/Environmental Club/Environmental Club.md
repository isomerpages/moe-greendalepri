Greendale Primary School strongly believes that environment education is an important component of a holistic education and adopts a whole-school approach towards environment care. Our Environmental Club aims to give our members experiences and exposure to an array of interesting activities to educate them on the importance of caring for our environment. It campaigns for the improvement of the environment through activities such as planting, recycling and educating the rest of the school on doing our part for our environment.
