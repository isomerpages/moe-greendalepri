## **Science Communication for CIN Ambassadors Workshop**


On 8 February 2019, sixteen Environmental Club members participated in the Science Communication for Community in Nature Ambassadors Workshop conducted by NParks at Tanglin Secondary School.

  

The students were able to apply various collaborative research and presentation skills during the session. The students were placed in different teams and required to design a poster each to share on a topic relating to the Singapore natural environment. Selecting from a variety of interests areas, such as animals and plants, endangerment of species and conservation; as well as being equipped with a laptop each, the groups created beautiful and engaging posters after research, and presented their findings to the other groups.
