## **A Fulfilling and Exciting Week For Our Environmental Club Members**


On 7 April 2017, our members participated in a ‘Love your food @ Schools’ Experiential Trail at Chongzheng Primary School. Through interactive and fun games, they learnt the undesirable consequences of food wastage, and the importance of not wasting food.

  

Our school is one of the ten schools in Singapore selected for the pilot programme ‘Love Your Food @ Schools Project’ organised by the National Environment Agency (NEA). Our vice-principal, Ms Joyce Chan, was there to receive a Certificate of Participation from the Guest of Honour of that day, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Masagos Zulkifli.
