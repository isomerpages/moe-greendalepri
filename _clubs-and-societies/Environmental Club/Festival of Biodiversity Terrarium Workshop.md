## **Festival of Biodiversity Terrarium Workshop**


On 2 June 2018, seven Community in Nature (CIN) members and four teachers conducted a terrarium workshop to guide the public attending the **‘Festival of Biodiversity’** event, which was held at the open space between Tampines MRT and Tampines Mall. A number of native plants were used in the terrarium making, including _Pellionia repens_ and _Asplenium nidus_.

  

The student guides volunteered enthusiastically and applied various skills during the workshop, such as publicity relation skills in attracting participants, communications skills in relaying instructions and observation skills in monitoring participants’ progress. They also learnt to be responsible in keeping the environs clean and tidy after the workshop. The student guides engaged have learnt that they too can play a part in contributing to a greener environment.
