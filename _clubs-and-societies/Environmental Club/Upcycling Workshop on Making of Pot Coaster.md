## **Upcycling Workshop on Making of Pot Coaster**


On 3 March 2017, 20 of our Environmental Club members and 10 of our Red Cross members attended a workshop by **‘WahSoSimple’** on upcycling.

  

During the workshop, pupils learnt how an old T-shirt at home can be given a new lease of life as a pot coaster. They experienced the entire process of making coasters starting from selecting suitable fabrics to be used, making appropriate measurements and sizing to proper dimensions, removing the lint from the cut fabric, then finally to tying them together as a pot coaster. The pupils had a fun time engaging their tactile skills as well as unleashing their creativity.
