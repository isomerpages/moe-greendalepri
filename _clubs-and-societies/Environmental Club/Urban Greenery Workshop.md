## **Urban Greenery Workshop**


On 29 June 2018, twenty-two Environmental Club members participated in the Urban Greenery Workshop initiated and conducted by Dr Terrence Tan, a research fellow from the National University of Singapore.

  

The students were able to work collaboratively and apply creative-thinking skills during the session. Equipped with a game set each, the groups unleashed their ideas and created simple blueprints of residential estates that integrate natural habitats with current urban living areas and lifestyles. The students were excited to be able to think creatively like eco-friendly designers, and felt that it was a memorable and enriching learning experience.
