You are invited to join the earliest girl band in the world – THE GIRLS’ BRIGADE.

  

The Girls’ Brigade Singapore (GBS) is an international uniformed youth organisation for girls, recognised by Ministry of Education of Singapore as a Co-Curricular Activity in the schools.

  

**<u>Our Mission</u>**

  

The mission of the Girls’ Brigade (GB) is to develop each Girl and Officer to her fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling:  

  

    • Every Girl a Leader.  
    • Every Officer a Servant Leader.



Through the GB Junior Programme the 87Th Coy aims to develop the character of our GB members in tandem with our GB mission and the school values of respect, commitment and collaboration.  
  
Due to the on-going Covid-19 situation in 2021, the Coy adopted social distancing and other precautionary health measures in the first semester for her face to face, in-person CCA sessions.  We implemented online CCA in the second semester.

**<u>What do we do?</u>**

  

Our training programme is geared towards developing the TOTAL girl – physically, educationally and socially. We inculcate moral values, develop character and provide training in leadership skills. Our members are encouraged to share what they have learnt in their homes, schools, community, nation and the region.
