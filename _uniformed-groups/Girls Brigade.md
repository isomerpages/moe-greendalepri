You are invited to join the earliest girl band in the world – THE GIRLS’ BRIGADE.

  

The Girls’ Brigade Singapore (GBS) is an international uniformed youth organisation for girls, recognised by Ministry of Education of Singapore as a Co-Curricular Activity in the schools.

  

**<u>Our Mission</u>**

  

The mission of the Girls’ Brigade (GB) is to develop each Girl and Officer to her fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling:  

  

    • Every Girl a Leader.  
    • Every Officer a Servant Leader.



Through the GB Junior Programme the 87Th Coy aims to develop the character of our GB members in tandem with our GB mission and the school values of respect, commitment and collaboration.  
  
Due to the on-going Covid-19 situation in 2021, the Coy adopted social distancing and other precautionary health measures in the first semester for her face to face, in-person CCA sessions.  We implemented online CCA in the second semester.

**<u>What do we do?</u>**

  

Our training programme is geared towards developing the TOTAL girl – physically, educationally and socially. We inculcate moral values, develop character and provide training in leadership skills. Our members are encouraged to share what they have learnt in their homes, schools, community, nation and the region.

The Girls’ Brigade is an established uniformed group with a long history of serving the community in Singapore. Started in Jan 2015, we form the 87th Company of Girls’ Brigade, Singapore. We provide meaningful and enjoyable programmes that are educational, physical and social for our pupils.

  

Some of our programmes include personal enrichment, adventure training and community service. Through these programmes, our girls are given opportunities to develop leadership qualities and life skills under the mentorship and guidance of the volunteer adult leaders. All these programmes embody our commitment to the total development of our students to become responsible and useful citizens of our nation.

  

The highlight event for the first half of 2015 was the Enrolment Service in March. The girls joined the Boys’ Brigade pupils to put up a song item to all the guests. Another highlight is the end of the term Games Day in which they played water games and laser tag.

##### **SILVER Award - Dr Low Guat Tin National Challenge**


  
The school’s Girls’ Brigade (GB), 87th Coy received a Silver Award at the Dr Low Guat Tin National Challenge on 16 August 2021.  
  
The National Challenge encourages GB girls to seek creative ways to improve the lives of those around them – expanding the boundaries of their capabilities and empathy towards their world.  The theme for this year is “Better Minds, Better Tomorrow”.  
  
Our GB Coy sent in 31 submissions. Of these, 5 received Silver and the rest, 26 Bronze award. Five of our P6 girls who won Silver put together their experiences on mental well-being, collaborated and produced a short video.  The other 26 members from mixed upper levels worked in groups and submitted posters and writing.  
  

##### **You are my Superhero! - GB appreciates our healthcare workers**


  

From 26th to 28th February 2020, Girls’ Brigade (GB) members rallied fellow pupils, teachers and staff members to sign big appreciation cards to present to healthcare workers in our hospitals.  Tag-lined “You are my Superhero!” the girls realized that they could show appreciation to the super heroes fighting the COVID-19 virus at the frontline.  These are our nurses, orderlies, cleaners, security guards, doctors, pharmacists, reception officers and many other healthcare workers in the hospitals.  

We hope that this service project has helped our GB members to live out their motto of “Every Girl, A Leader” while practising school values of ‘Appreciation’, ‘Respect’ and ‘Graciousness’.  At the same time, our girls have also contributed to the two pillars of Total Defence, namely, ‘Psychological Defence’ and ‘Social Defence’.

**These are what some of our GB girls have to say about the VIA project.**

 _“That people are really grateful and appreciate the doctors and nurses at the hard times. I am glad that our pupils are more than happy to sign the cards.”_

   _**Jeeya, Primary 5 Compassion**_
	 
 _“Many people are writing letters to doctors and nurses in Singapore.  So the people in the hospital feel better.”_

**Keshini, Primary 4 Compassion**

 _“I observed that a lot of efforts had been put to make the cards…I will appreciate the nurses, health care workers and doctors more.”_

**Xin Tong, Primary 6 Compassion**

<br>
<br>
The final tally of 55 A3 size encouragement cards have been posted to 3 hospitals, namely, Sengkang General Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.

##### **Building Up Resilience in GB**  

Do you know that the 87th Coy Girls’ Brigade (GB) members have been practising hard in their drills since late 2019?  Originally, our goal was to enter the National Drill Competition scheduled in March 2020.  The competition has been cancelled due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak.  

Despite this setback, the girls never gave up.  They still continue with the drills during CCA on Fridays.  Our new goal is the school showcase to fellow Boys’ Brigade members on 13 March 2020, at the end of Term 1.  Being in a drill inculcates the school values of respect, resilience, commitment and collaboration in our GB girls.  Team comradery is strengthened as we work towards a common goal.
