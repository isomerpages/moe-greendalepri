<p>At our Chess Club, we believe that every move on the board is a step toward
building sharper minds and stronger character. Open to pupils of all levels—from
beginners to experienced players—the Chess CCA provides a fun and focused
environment where pupils develop critical thinking, strategic planning,
and concentration.</p>
<p>Through weekly sessions, chess members learn fundamental rules, tactics,
and advanced strategies. They engage in friendly matches and puzzle-solving
activities that challenge their minds and nurture resilience. Beyond the
board, pupils build confidence, patience, and good sportsmanship—skills
that benefit them in both academic and everyday situations.</p>
<p>Our Chess Club also prepares keen players for school-based and external
competitions, offering them the chance to test their skills and grow through
experience. Whether a pupil joins to learn a new skill or to compete at
a higher level, the Chess Club is a space where every learner is empowered
to think ahead, stay focused, and enjoy the game.</p>
