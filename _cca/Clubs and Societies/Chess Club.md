## **Chess Club**

![](/images/CCA/Chess%201.jpeg)


Our Chess Club is set up with the objective of promoting intellectual games. It aims to introduce basic chess playing skills to members and help them develop higher order thinking skills such as the ability to visualize, analyze, and think critically. Through chess, the CCA members will improve their ability to focus on tasks. When playing chess, the pupils will see the importance of thinking ahead, trying to figure out their opponent’s next move and their own alternatives moves. There is evidence that chess-playing school children significantly outperform non-playing children in literacy, numeracy and problem solving skills. Chess is a game with no barriers as people of any age, gender, race and social class can all play.
