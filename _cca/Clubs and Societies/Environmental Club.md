<p>Greendale Primary School strongly believes that environment education
is an important component of a holistic education and adopts a whole-school
approach towards environment care. Our Environmental Club aims to give
our members experiences and exposure to an array of interesting activities
to educate them on the importance of caring for our environment. It campaigns
for the improvement of the environment through activities such as planting,
recycling and educating the rest of the school on doing our part for our
environment.</p>
