<h2><strong>Infocomm Club</strong></h2>
<p>The club aims to cultivate our studentsâ€™ interest and develop skills in
the information and communication technology, through experiential learning.&nbsp;We
offer a variety of activities from photography, videography to coding and
flying drones. Through the fun activities and projects, our members will
appreciate technologies better and creatively apply their skills to communicate
ideas and use them in their school projects.</p>
