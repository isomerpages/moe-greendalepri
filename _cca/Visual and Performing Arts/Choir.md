<p>The GDPS Choir, established in 2010, aims to nurture students with a deep
passion for singing while providing a platform to develop key school values
such as resilience and teamwork. Through structured and progressive vocal
and solfège training, each member is guided to develop their musical abilities
to the fullest.</p>
<p>Today, our choir members confidently perform as a unified ensemble, showcasing
their ability to harmonise and apply their musical skills with precision
and expression. They are exposed to a diverse repertoire of musical genres
and are regularly provided with opportunities to perform at both school-based
and external events, allowing them to grow as confident and well-rounded
performers. In 2024, our choristers achieved the <strong>Certificate of Distinction</strong> in
the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</strong>, a testament to their
hard work, dedication, and musical excellence.</p>
<p>The GDPS Choir provides a nurturing platform for students to develop their
musical talents and school values. Through dedicated training and performance
opportunities, members grow in confidence, teamwork, and excellence—making
the choir a fulfilling and enriching experience.</p>
