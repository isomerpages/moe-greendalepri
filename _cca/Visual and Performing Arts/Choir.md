<h2><strong>Choir</strong></h2>
<p>GDPS Choir started in 2010 with the vision of developing students with
a passion for singing. It is also a platform for students to enhance their
school values, such as strengthening resilience and collaborating in a
team.</p>
<p>The choir members undergo rigorous vocal and solfege training with an
objective to develop each member to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Today, our musically-inclined members are able to blend their voices harmoniously
and apply their musical skills in their ensemble.</p>
<p>Our members are also exposed to a repository of musical genres. They are
also given opportunities for in-house and outdoor performances.</p>
