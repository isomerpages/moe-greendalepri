## **International Dance**

**<u>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</u>**

In April 2018, we represented our school and participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). Through the many practices, we learnt to persevere and became very united as a team. Being part of this allowed us to articulate our thoughts and express our feelings through the arts. We were so happy and proud that we managed to achieve Distinction again!

**<u>Values in Action (VIA)</u>**

  

For our Values in action (VIA) Programme, we went to a kindergarten to teach them how to dance. We got together and discussed how we should simplify the dance moves we had learnt for the kindergarten kids. Initially, we were a little afraid and felt a little awkward. However, the kindergarten kids warmed up to us pretty quickly. It was a fun time teaching, interacting and dancing with the little kids.

**<u>School events – Teachers’ Day</u>**

  

We also took part in a few school events. One of them was Teachers’ Day. We danced for our Teachers and hoped that they enjoyed our energetic and electrifying dance moves. We danced to the popular song "Du du du".

**<u>School events- Annual Prize Presentation (AAP)</u>**

  

We also participated in our school’s Annual Prize Presentation (AAP). It was the first time that we (the junior dancers) were performing. We learnt the dance in 9 sessions! It was a fun and an exhilarating first experience.

**<u>Learning&nbsp; Journey – Super 24 Competition 2018</u>**

  

Every year, our teachers will bring us out to watch a dance performance. We managed to watch the Super 24 Dance Competition at the Singapore Sports Hub. We were so impressed by the secondary school dancers. We watched a variety of dance genres such as hip hop, contemporary, lyrical, street jazz…etc.&nbsp; The whole place was filled with people who were so passionate for dance and we were all so inspired. The dance, music and lightings made the place so electrifying! We hope that in future, we will be able to dance like them.

It was a fun yet busy month of June for Team Greendale’s International Dance.

  

We were honored to represent our school in two dance competitions.

  

On 22nd June, 16 of our dancers represented Greendale Primary in a dance competition cum VIA program organised by HCA Hospice Care, with the theme Color The Wind, Let’s Go, at Aliwal Arts Centre (Champions).&nbsp; The judges and audience were enthralled and captivated by the medley item.

  

We were up against 9 other schools; 2 other primary schools, 9 secondary and higher institutions. We won Best Ensemble&nbsp; at the end of the competition!

A few days later, on the 24th June, 6 of our dancers represented Greendale Primary in a dance and singing competition, organised by Mediacorp TV. The Sheng Siong Show, which was telecast LIVE on Channel 8, was a milestone for our dance team as we appeared for the very first time on national television.&nbsp; Our dance team was a unique and diverse one. Belting out Elva’s&nbsp; Xiao Sa Xiao Jie, our dancers sure did us proud! On 3rd July, we had the honour of performing in front of Mr Tony Tan during the Heartware Network 17th Anniversary Gala Dinner 2017 at Mandarin Orchard Hotel.
