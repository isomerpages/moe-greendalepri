<h2><strong>Art</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Art Club is a safe space for the exploration and experiential learning
of Art beyond the boundaries of the classroom. It is also a platform for
students to extend their interest in Art. Opportunities are given for students
to participate in nationwide competition such as Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF), to go for learning journeys to the museum and to learn and create
art based on art techniques learnt.</p>
<p>The Art Club at our school is a fun and welcoming place where young artists
can explore their creativity and imagination. Art club gives children the
chance to try new art activities, learn different techniques, and most
importantly—have fun while making art!</p>
<p>Each week, we enjoy hands-on projects like drawing, painting, resin art,
3D pen, and ceramics.</p>
