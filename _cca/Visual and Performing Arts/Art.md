## **Art**&nbsp;

Art Club is a safe space for the exploration and experiential learning of Art beyond the boundaries of the classroom. It is also a platform for students to extend their interest in Art. Opportunities are given for students to participate in nationwide competition such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), to go for learning journeys to the museum and to learn and create art based on art techniques learnt.

**<u>Artist Statement</u>**

The idea of staple food is used to symbolise technology which has become an important element in our lives.&nbsp;

The healthy diet plate contrasts with the large quantity of food and technological parts. Just like food, when digital consumption goes beyond its recommended portion, it is not beneficial to us.&nbsp;

**<u>Artist statement</u>**

We created a neighbourhood precinct using a QR code as inspiration because it has become an integral part of our lives. The QR code reads ‘LIFE’ from the top.&nbsp;

The surroundings and the windows at the side of the buildings show scenes of daily life.
