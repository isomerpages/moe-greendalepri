<h2><strong>Art</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Art Club is a safe space for the exploration and experiential learning
of Art beyond the boundaries of the classroom. It is also a platform for
students to extend their interest in Art. Opportunities are given for students
to participate in nationwide competition such as Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF), to go for learning journeys to the museum and to learn and create
art based on art techniques learnt.</p>
