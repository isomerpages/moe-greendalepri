## **Guitar**

Which type of music do you like? Rock? Pop? Jazz? Blues? Classical? Join the Guitar Club to discover how a six string classical instrument can resonate such beautiful melodies that even some orchestras have them!

  

Pupils will learn musical notations and technical skills such as strumming and plucking. The exposure to musical and artistic components is an integral part in developing the personality and art appreciation of the pupils. With familiar repertoires to play to, pupils will enjoy this CCA and achieve confidence to perform on the big stage.
