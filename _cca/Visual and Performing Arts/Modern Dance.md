<br>The Ministry of Education annually hosts the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) to celebrate the energy and talents of our young students in the
field of Arts.</p>
<p>SYF has several goals:
<br>It serves as a platform for nurturing character development, 21st-century
skills, and emotional intelligence through artistic expression. By encouraging
participation in arts co-curricular activities (CCA) in schools, where
students can either actively engage in the arts as CCA members or enjoy
artistic performances and exhibitions as audience members. It celebrates
the vibrancy of our youth by showcasing a wide array of artistic talents
and creative expressions. It contributes to nation-building by fostering
cultural awareness and appreciation through aesthetics education.</p>
<p>The SYF comprises three main components:
<br>Arts Presentation, Art Exhibition, and Celebrations.</p>

<p>Each year, our dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) arranges an annual outing
to witness live dance presentations. This exposure serves as a wellspring
of inspiration and motivation for our dance CCA members, showcasing the
extraordinary achievements made possible through unwavering dedication
and innate talent. Attending these performances provides our students with
invaluable learning opportunities by allowing them to glean insights from
accomplished dancers and choreographers. They have the chance to observe
a diverse array of dance styles, techniques, and artistic interpretations,
ultimately enriching their own dance skills and comprehension.</p>
<p>This year, the Dance CCA members went to watch the technical rehearsal
of SOTA’s (School of The Arts) dance showcase, Rapport 2023. The students
were treated to performances choreographed by their Dance Faculty and industry
professionals, performed by our Year 4, 5, 6 dance students. Many of them
also reflected that watching the performance have inspired them to do better.</p>
<p><strong><u>Dance Values in Action (VIA)</u></strong> 
<br>
<br>

<p>Our dance CCA also embarked on a Values-in-Action (VIA) project. In this
initiative, they engaged in a "Design for Change" project that involved
a four-stage process: "Feel," "Imagine," "Do," and "Share."</p>
<p>In the initial "Feel" stage, our students observed and identified issues
that concerned them. In the "Imagine" phase, they brainstormed creative
solutions to address these issues. Subsequently, in the "Do" stage, they
collaborated in teams to implement their chosen solutions. Finally, in
the "Share" phase, they shared their transformative solutions with the
broader community to inspire others to take action, fostering a spirit
of "I CAN!"</p>
<p>For their VIA project, the focus of our dance CCA was on our school's
kindergarten pupils and teachers. They developed interview questions and
carefully analysed the responses they received. Ultimately, they decided
to alleviate the workload of our kindergarten teachers, who were tasked
with choreographing three dances for the K2 graduation performance. To
achieve this, our dance CCA members put their heads together to choreograph
a dance using the song by Justin Timberlake “Can’t Stop the Feeling” They
then dedicated an afternoon to teach the kindergarten students the choreography
they had created.</p>
