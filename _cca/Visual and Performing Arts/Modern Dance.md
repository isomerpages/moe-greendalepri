<h2><strong>Modern Dance</strong></h2>
<p>Modern dance has long been an established CCA, admired and respected by
many Greendalites. The CCA has garnered numerous accolades over the years
and is known for its dedicated dancers, who are deeply passionate about
the art form. Every two years, the Greendalite dancers showcase their talents
at the Singapore Youth Festival, consistently exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Modern Dance CCA organizes an annual Values-in-Action
(VIA) project. For this initiative, the dancers engage in a "Design for
Change" project, which follows a four-step process: "Feel," "Imagine,"
"Do," and "Share." This project typically involves outreach to the kindergarten
students and teachers at our school. In 2024, the dancers developed interview
questions, analyzed the responses, and decided to ease the workload of
the kindergarten teachers, who were responsible for choreographing three
dances for the K2 graduation. In response, the dance CCA members collaborated
to choreograph a dance to Justin Timberlake's "Can't Stop the Feeling,"
dedicating an afternoon to teaching the choreography to the kindergarten
students.
<br>
<br>Each year, the Modern Dance CCA organizes an outing to attend live dance
performances. This exposure serves as a powerful source of inspiration
and motivation for our dancers, highlighting the incredible accomplishments
achieved through dedication and natural talent. Attending these performances
offers invaluable learning opportunities, allowing our students to learn
from accomplished dancers and choreographers. They have the chance to observe
various dance styles, techniques, and artistic interpretations, ultimately
enhancing their own skills and understanding of dance.
