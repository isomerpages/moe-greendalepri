When you join the Chinese painting club, you will be learning a traditional art form that dates back centuries!  Traditional painting involves essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and is done with a brush dipped in black or coloured ink; oils are not used.

  

As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made of are paper and silk. Come and join us to experience the culture and discipline of this art.
