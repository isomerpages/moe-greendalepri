<h2><strong>Netball (Girls Only)</strong></h2>
<p>Netball is the number one girls' school sport in Singapore with 330 schools
running it as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). The Netball CCA in Greendale
Primary School aims to provide opportunities for pupils to learn and apply
the fundamental netball skills and simple court play strategies in playing
a netball game.</p>
<p>The pupils will also learn to embrace the values of excellence, sportsmanship
and fair play. Training involves basic ball skills, stamina building, agility
and coordination exercises under the close supervision of the coach and
teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>Team Greendale will also be training progressively to prepare pupils to
represent the school in the North Zone Netball Tournament and carnivals
organised by Netball Singapore. We look forward to maximising the exposure
and experience of the girls in our CCA.</p>
