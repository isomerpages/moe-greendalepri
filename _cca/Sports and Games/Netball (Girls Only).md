<h2><strong>Netball (Girls Only)</strong></h2>
<p>Through Netball CCA, we hope to inculcate our school values as well as
sportsmanship among our netball girls. We also hope that our netball girls
will forge lifelong friendships through the love of the sport.</p>
<p>In term 1, our netball senior girls had made the school proud by winning
3 games consecutively during the National School Games (NSG) Senior Girls
(Pool Round). In addition, our senior girls are qualified to enter the
league round which will be held in Term 2. All the best, girls!
