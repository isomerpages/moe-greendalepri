<h2><strong>Volleyball</strong></h2>
<p>Volleyball adopts a tactical game approach concept that places pupils
at the centre to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What to do (tactical awareness);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to do it (skill execution);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When to do it (timing); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where to do it (space).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils will be taught the skills and techniques for net barrier games
and will be given exposure to develop their leadership potential.</p>
<p>Our team participates in the Inter-Schools Volleyball Championships and
the various volleyball carnivals. If you like challenge, join our CCA!</p>
