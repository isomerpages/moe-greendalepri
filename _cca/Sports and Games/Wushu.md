## **Wushu**


Wushu is a martial art with its origins traced to self-defense needs, hunting activities and military training in ancient China. With time, Wushu expanded its purpose from self-defense to health and finally as a way of instilling self-discipline. If you want to improve your flexibility, agility and physical strength, join us!

  

In our Wushu training sessions, pupils will learn the martial art and how to master different types of Chinese traditional weapons. Pupils will also learn important values such as resilience, respect for others, sportsmanship and integrity.

  

Our Wushu members have represented the school during events such as Punggol Street Parade and added vibrant energy during our Chinese New Year concerts. They have also made the school proud during the National School Games.
