<h2><strong>Wushu</strong></h2>
<p>Wushu is a martial art with its origins traced to self-defense needs,
hunting activities and military training in ancient China. With time, Wushu
expanded its purpose from self-defense to health and finally as a way of
instilling self-discipline. If you want to improve your flexibility, agility
and physical strength, join us!</p>
<p>In our Wushu training sessions, pupils will learn the martial art and
how to master different types of Chinese traditional weapons. Pupils will
also learn important values such as resilience, respect for others, sportsmanship
and integrity.</p>
<p>Our Wushu members have represented the school during events such as Punggol
Street Parade and added vibrant energy during our Chinese New Year concerts.
They have also made the school proud during the National School Games.</p>
