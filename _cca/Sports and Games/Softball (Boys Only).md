<h2><strong>Softball (Boys Only)</strong></h2>
<p>This will likely be your child’s first experience getting involved in
playing Softball, and our most important job is to make sure that the boys
have FUN!</p>
<p>Our 2-hour sessions are a balance of skills training and games to keep
the boys engaged.</p>
<p>Our goal is to introduce the basics of the game, catching, throwing and
hitting, running to bases, communication &amp; the concept of attack and
defense. Many boys will also be experiencing a team environment, and we
spend time working on both individual skills and team situations. We keep
things simple and repetitive, with progression on certain skills as we
move on through the year. The highlight of every year is competing in the
National School Games (NSG), we currently have two teams competing in it(Junior
&amp; Senior). Our senior boys made it to the top 4 last year (2024) in
the Softball National Championships!</p>
<p>Training time is detailed above (please arrive 10 minutes earlier).</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you and welcoming you into the Softball Family!</p>
