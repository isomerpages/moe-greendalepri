<p>Softball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams on a large field.
It evolved from baseball with some key differences: softballs are larger
than baseballs and the pitches are thrown underhand rather than overhand.
Despite the game's name, the standard softball is not soft; in fact, it
is harder than a baseball.</p>
<p>Softball is a team sport, and much like others, every player needs the
basic skills and plays a crucial role to ensure the success of the team.
Similar to all sports, softball skills are learned at an early age and
that same skills get honed later in life when seeking to improve the level
of play. Catching, hitting and throwing the ball are some of the basics.
By practising these fundamentals, kids can become better softball players.</p>
<p>This sport also provides opportunities for the softball players to cultivate
important values and life skills such as graciousness, resilience, appreciation,
commitment and collaboration, excellence and integrity which ties in with
the school values.</p>
<p>We currently have both Junior and Senior boys in the softball team. Our
senior boys made it to the top 4 last year (2018) in the Softball National
Championships!</p>
