<h2><strong>Table Tennis (Boys only)</strong></h2>
<p>In table tennis, we provide the best possible training and environment
for members to reach their fullest sporting potential. As the members learn
to master the fundamental skills and strategies of table tennis, they are
also building their endurance and stamina to improve their level of fitness.
Additionally, we aim to develop sportsmanship and build friendship and
integrity among the members, allowing them to learn the value of discipline,
teamwork, respect, responsibility and perseverance.</p>
<p>Although we promote table tennis as a recreational sport, we also identify
and nurture talented players to become the best that they can be. Players
selected get to participate in the Inter-School Table Tennis competitions.</p>
