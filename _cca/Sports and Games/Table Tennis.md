<h2><strong>Table Tennis (Boys only)</strong></h2>
<p>Our Table Tennis CCA provides a structured and supportive environment
for students to develop their skills and reach their fullest sporting potential.
Through dedicated training, members not only master the fundamental techniques
and strategies of table tennis but also build endurance and stamina, enhancing
their overall fitness.</p>
<p>Beyond the game, we emphasize the importance of sportsmanship, teamwork,
and integrity. Our CCA instills values such as discipline, respect, responsibility,
and perseverance, fostering character development alongside technical proficiency.</p>
<p>During our training sessions, we identify and nurture talented players,
providing them with opportunities to excel. Selected players represent
the school in the Inter-School Table Tennis Competitions, where they showcase
their skills and sportsmanship on a competitive platform.</p>
