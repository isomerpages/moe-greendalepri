<p>The Girls’ Brigade is an established uniformed group with a long history
of serving the community in Singapore. Started in Jan 2015, we form the
87th Company of Girls’ Brigade, Singapore. We provide meaningful and enjoyable
programmes that are educational, physical and social for our pupils.</p>
<p>Some of our programmes include personal enrichment, adventure training
and community service. Through these programmes, our girls are given opportunities
to develop leadership qualities and life skills under the mentorship and
guidance of the volunteer adult leaders. All these programmes embody our
commitment to the total development of our students to become responsible
and useful citizens of our nation.</p>
