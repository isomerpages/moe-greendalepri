<p>You are invited to join the earliest girl band in the world – THE GIRLS’
BRIGADE.</p>
<p>The Girls’ Brigade Singapore (GBS) is an international uniformed youth
organisation for girls, recognised by Ministry of Education of Singapore
as a Co-Curricular Activity in the schools.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Mission</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The mission of the Girls’ Brigade (GB) is to develop each Girl and Officer
to her fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling:</p>
<p>• Every Girl a Leader.
<br>• Every Officer a Servant Leader.</p>
<p>Through the GB Junior Programme the 87Th Coy aims to develop the character
of our GB members in tandem with our GB mission and the school values of
respect, commitment and collaboration.</p>
<p>Due to the on-going Covid-19 situation in 2021, the Coy adopted social
distancing and other precautionary health measures in the first semester
for her face to face, in-person CCA sessions.&nbsp; We implemented online
CCA in the second semester.</p>
<p><strong><u>What do we do?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our training programme is geared towards developing the TOTAL girl – physically,
educationally and socially. We inculcate moral values, develop character
and provide training in leadership skills. Our members are encouraged to
share what they have learnt in their homes, schools, community, nation
and the region.</p>

<p>The Girls’ Brigade is an established uniformed group with a long history
of serving the community in Singapore. Started in Jan 2015, we form the
87th Company of Girls’ Brigade, Singapore. We provide meaningful and enjoyable
programmes that are educational, physical and social for our pupils.</p>
<p>Some of our programmes include personal enrichment, adventure training
and community service. Through these programmes, our girls are given opportunities
to develop leadership qualities and life skills under the mentorship and
guidance of the volunteer adult leaders. All these programmes embody our
commitment to the total development of our students to become responsible
and useful citizens of our nation.</p>
<p>The highlight event for the first half of 2015 was the Enrolment Service
in March. The girls joined the Boys’ Brigade pupils to put up a song item
to all the guests. Another highlight is the end of the term Games Day in
which they played water games and laser tag.</p>

<h5><strong>SILVER Award - Dr Low Guat Tin National Challenge</strong></h5>
<p>The school’s Girls’ Brigade (GB), 87th Coy received a Silver Award at
the Dr Low Guat Tin National Challenge on 16 August 2021.</p>
<p>The National Challenge encourages GB girls to seek creative ways to improve
the lives of those around them – expanding the boundaries of their capabilities
and empathy towards their world.  The theme for this year is “Better Minds,
Better Tomorrow”.</p>
<p>Our GB Coy sent in 31 submissions. Of these, 5 received Silver and the
rest, 26 Bronze award. Five of our P6 girls who won Silver put together
their experiences on mental well-being, collaborated and produced a short
video.&nbsp; The other 26 members from mixed upper levels worked in groups
and submitted posters and writing.</p>
<h5><strong>You are my Superhero! - GB appreciates our healthcare workers</strong></h5>
<p>From 26th&nbsp;to 28th&nbsp;February 2020, Girls’ Brigade (GB) members
rallied fellow pupils, teachers and staff members to sign big appreciation
cards to present to healthcare workers in our hospitals.&nbsp; Tag-lined
“You are my Superhero!” the girls realized that they could show appreciation
to the super heroes fighting the COVID-19 virus at the frontline.&nbsp;
These are our nurses, orderlies, cleaners, security guards, doctors, pharmacists,
reception officers and many other healthcare workers in the hospitals.</p>
<p>We hope that this service project has helped our GB members to live out
their motto of “Every Girl, A Leader” while practising school values of
‘Appreciation’, ‘Respect’ and ‘Graciousness’.&nbsp; At the same time, our
girls have also contributed to the two pillars of Total Defence, namely,
‘Psychological Defence’ and ‘Social Defence’.</p>
<p><strong>These are what some of our GB girls have to say about the VIA project.</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“That people are really grateful and appreciate the doctors and nurses at the hard times. I am glad that our pupils are more than happy to sign the cards.”</em> 
<br><strong><em>Jeeya, Primary 5 Compassion</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Many people are writing letters to doctors and nurses in Singapore.&nbsp; So the people in the hospital feel better.”</em> 
<br><strong>Keshini, Primary 4 Compassion</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I observed that a lot of efforts had been put to make the cards…I will appreciate the nurses, health care workers and doctors more.”</em> 
<br><strong>Xin Tong, Primary 6 Compassion</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>The final tally of 55 A3 size encouragement cards have been posted to
3 hospitals, namely, Sengkang General Hospital, Changi General Hospital
and Singapore General Hospital.</p>

<h5><strong>Building Up Resilience in GB</strong></h5>
<p>Do you know that the 87th Coy Girls’ Brigade (GB) members have been practising
hard in their drills since late 2019?&nbsp; Originally, our goal was to
enter the National Drill Competition scheduled in March 2020.&nbsp; The
competition has been cancelled due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this setback, the girls never gave up.&nbsp; They still continue
with the drills during CCA on Fridays.&nbsp; Our new goal is the school
showcase to fellow Boys’ Brigade members on 13 March 2020, at the end of
Term 1.&nbsp; Being in a drill inculcates the school values of respect,
resilience, commitment and collaboration in our GB girls.&nbsp; Team comradery
is strengthened as we work towards a common goal.</p>

<h5><strong>Girls’ Brigade takes on the Dr Low Guat Tin (LGT) Challenge 2019</strong></h5>
<p>Our Girls’ Brigade 87th company sent a team of eight P5 girls to take
part in the Dr Low Guat Tin (LGT) Challenge on 1st June (Sat) 2019. The
LGT Challenge is a national completion that is held biennially. The pupils
were challenged to code and program a Micro:bit device that would help
the environment.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CCA/Girls%20Brigade/GB%2015.jpg">
</div>
<p>Due to the recent dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding the
1962 Water Agreement and the recent commemoration of World Water Day on
22nd March 2019, the girls decided to program the Micro:bit to create awareness
on the amount of water wasted in the canteen and highlight the importance
of saving water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the technical knowledge gained from attending a Micro:bit workshop,
the girls managed to code the device independently and learned problem-solving
skills. Their end-product consisted of a timer that calculated the amount
of water wasted per second if users washed their hands for an extended
duration. LED lights on the device were also programmed to light up to
serve as a visual cue for those washing their hands.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CCA/Girls%20Brigade/GB%2016.jpg">
</div>
<p>As a result of their participation in this challenge, the girls learnt
research skills such as data collection and critical thinking. They also
exhibited the school values of commitment and collaboration while working
together and supported one another when faced with a problem. They overcame
their shyness to confidently present the device to the judges. Through
the hard work and effort put into their Micro:bit device, the girls aimed
for excellence and managed to clinch a bronze award for this year’s LGT
Challenge!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>GB Appreciates Heritage</strong></h5>
<p>A beckon came from the past to visit Telok Ayer. The Girls’ Brigade heeded
this gentle call when the Coy went on the Pioneer’s Trail at Ann Siang
Hill on 12 April 2019. The learning journey hoped to inculcate in our GB
members, our school values of appreciation and respect.</p>
<p>Also as part of the school's Learning for Life Programme through Outdoor
Education, the GB members developed a greater sense of place as Singaporeans
through increasing their awareness of the history and culture of the Telok
Ayer area. They had a glimpse of how the pioneers lived out daily lives
in the multi-racial society at that time. GB members knew more about the
different historical buildings and learnt how to better appreciate the
architectural heritage at Ann Siang Hill area.</p>
<p>Our girls are indeed privileged to have been able to take part in this
heritage tour organised by the National Parks Board, in commemoration of
the Singapore Bicentennial.</p>

<h5><strong>Smart Way Forward</strong></h5>
<p>In line with Singapore’s “Smart Nation” initiative, the Girls’ Brigade
(GB), with the support of GB Headquarters, attended a series of information
technology workshops on 1 March and 8 March 2019. The workshops were conducted
in the new Tampines Regional Library where our girls learnt about coding
and its uses in various technological applications.</p>

<h5><strong>GB Brings Care and Festive Joy</strong></h5>
<p>The 87th&nbsp;Coy of the Girls’ Brigade (GB) visited the Bright Hill Evergreen
Home on 25 January 2019.&nbsp; As this event was near the Lunar New Year,
the GB members included some festive celebrations.</p>
<p>As part of the pre-visit preparations, the company of 39 members prepared
a Chinese song “早安老师_zao3 an1 lao3 shi1_” (“Good morning, Teacher”).&nbsp;
This song was a popular drama serial theme song in the 1980s. Our GB girls
learnt how to make paper lanterns.&nbsp; Making decorative objects out
of unused red packets instead of throwing them away increases the awareness
of ‘reuse’ and ‘recycle’, and general conservation of our living resources.&nbsp;
These Lunar New Year Lanterns were personally presented to the residents.</p>
<p>While it took some time for the young GB members to ‘break the ice’ with
the elderly residents at the start, our girls eventually warmed up and
learnt how to be gracious when interacting with the elders.&nbsp; They
also helped to serve the residents tea and cakes.&nbsp; There was a high
level of excitement in the air when the elderly residents strove to win
at the bingo game our girls conducted.</p>
<p>This visit marks GB’s first Values-In-Action (VIA) project in the year.&nbsp;
Through such VIA projects, GB hopes to promote values of graciousness,
service, respect and develop to be&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong> onfident,&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong> aring
and&nbsp;<strong><u>A</u></strong> ctive contributors.</p>

<h5><strong>GB gets Smart</strong></h5>
<p>In line with Singapore’s ‘Smart Nation’ initiative and under the flagship
of the Girls Brigade (GB) Headquarters, a group of our Primary 4 GB members
attended a Digital Maker workshop at Temasek Polytechnic on 21 May 2018.</p>
<p>Our girls were taught the basics of block coding using Microbits.&nbsp;
They were taught how to code for a motion sensor and a light sensor.&nbsp;
Though the items are small and coding is simple, the final digital maker
may prove to be of help to all and sundry.&nbsp; For example, the motion
and light sensors could be integrated into a night light for the elderly.</p>
<p>The GB members would be showcasing their ideas at a GB Friendship Day
event on 14 July 2018.</p>
