<p><strong><u>Boy’s Brigade 20<sup>th</sup> Junior Company (20J)</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>20J - The 'Greendale Primary' Company</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The movement is called The Boys' Brigade and the local unit is known as
the Company, thus your child is joining the Singapore Company. The Boys’
Brigade contingent in Greendale Primary School is jointly sponsored by
Greendale Primary School and Changi Methodist Church.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Uniform</u></strong>

<p>The Boys proudly put on their uniforms to help them develop a sense of
discipline, identity and belonging. Boys of this age have a strong tendency
to form groups and they recognise leadership and the displaying of loyalty
to the groups. It is this inclination that the Boys’ Brigade is fostering,
that the Boys will know and come to appreciate teamwork. With many group
activities during CCA days, the boys learn to work with one another. They
eventually begin to appreciate one another’s strengths and learn to support
each other in times of difficulty. Through the many challenges, leaders
are also born and developed.</p>

<p>Boys put on their BB Polo when they are engaged in sports or rigorous
activities. The Polo attire allows the boys to be more comfortable when
engaging in sports.</p>
