<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Learning by Design – Authentic Problem-solving through Design Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Greendale Primary School has developed our unique Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), ‘Learning by Design’, to inspire students to use their knowledge
and skills with creativity and innovation. This programme aims to cultivate
adaptive and inventive thinkers who show empathy and care by engaging in
authentic problem-solving through Design Thinking.</p>
<p>Through the ALP and at appropriate stages of their cognitive development,
our students will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learn to express their ideas visually in innovative ways to highlight
their thoughts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Showcase their learning and understanding in research, user empathy, design
development, and prototyping; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate application of Design Thinking processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts a two-tiered approach for our ALP. At Tier 1, we provide
a resource-rich learning environment to develop student Design Thinking
(DT) competencies for all our students through customised level programmes
as shown below:</p>
