<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Learning by Design – Authentic Problem-solving through Design Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Greendale Primary School has developed our unique Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), ‘Learning by Design’, to inspire students to use their knowledge
and skills with creativity and innovation. This programme aims to cultivate
adaptive and inventive thinkers who show empathy and care by engaging in
authentic problem-solving through Design Thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>This theme, 'Toys', is used as it creates much interest among all levels
of students, who will have lots of fun creating and designing their favourite
toys using recycled items and concepts they have learnt in their daily
lessons. We also believe that by getting the students to draw links between
Science and the other subjects as well as to apply knowledge and skills
from the academic curriculum into the project, this helps to spark their
interest and develop them to be better problem-solvers in real world situations.</p>
<p>Besides piquing their sense of creativity and interest, students have
the opportunity to contribute actively to group decisions and develop their
confidence by sharing their ideas at group and class level. The project
will also require them to be self-directed in doing research and looking
for ideas and information. With the collaborative nature of this project,
students will be able to further hone their competencies in self-management,
relationship management and social awareness through their interactions
with their peers.</p>
<p>Finally, the culmination of their learning is showcased via the Toy Carnival
in which the students have to present their projects to their classmates,
teachers and parents, and this helps to build their confidence in public
speaking as well.</p>
