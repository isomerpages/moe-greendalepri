## **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

**Toy Story – A Toy design project**  
  

**Introduction**

  

To encourage our students to use their knowledge and skills imaginatively and with daring innovation, Greendale Primary School has developed our distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) known as 'Toy Story'. The primary objective of this programme is to develop critical and creative thinking skills through the process of toy design and creation. Students will be taught creative thinking tools such as Edward de Bono’s 6 Thinking Hats (Primary 1 to 3) and SCAMPER by Bob Eberle (Primary 4 to 6). They will also be introduced to selected Visible Thinking Routines with the purpose of inspiring our students to constantly think of new and creative ways of solving problems and inculcating in them an innovative approach to their studies and life.

  

**Approach**

  

This theme, 'Toys', is used as it creates much interest among all levels of students, who will have lots of fun creating and designing their favourite toys using recycled items and concepts they have learnt in their daily lessons. We also believe that by getting the students to draw links between Science and the other subjects as well as to apply knowledge and skills from the academic curriculum into the project, this helps to spark their interest and develop them to be better problem-solvers in real world situations.

  

Besides piquing their sense of creativity and interest, students have the opportunity to contribute actively to group decisions and develop their confidence by sharing their ideas at group and class level. The project will also require them to be self-directed in doing research and looking for ideas and information. With the collaborative nature of this project, students will be able to further hone their competencies in self-management, relationship management and social awareness through their interactions with their peers.

  

Finally, the culmination of their learning is showcased via the Toy Carnival in which the students have to present their projects to their classmates, teachers and parents, and this helps to build their confidence in public speaking as well.
